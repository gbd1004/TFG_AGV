    abstract = {In recent years, the use of renewable energies has been promoted in most of developed countries due to the climate change threat. In this scenario, the importance of geothermal installations has increased. This paper focuses on a heat exchanger present on a geothermal installation. The main aim is to achieve an accurate prediction system using the previous readings of some of the sensors located along the heat exchanger. Different time series modeling techniques were applied obtaining satisfactory results in the prediction of the heat exchanger state during one year. This prediction is made 1 h, 3 h and 6 h in advance. Also, a strong correlation between the sensor readings is concluded, offering the possibility to dispense some of them.}

  abstract = {This book offers a comprehensive introduction to relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases. The authors thoroughly review the current state of database tools and techniques, and examine coming innovations. The book opens with a broad look at data management, including an overview of information systems and databases, and an explanation of contemporary database types: SQL and NoSQL databases, and their respective management systems The nature and uses of Big Data A high-level view of the organization of data management Data Modeling and Consistency Chapter-length treatment is afforded Data Modeling in both relational and graph databases, including enterprise-wide data architecture, and formulas for database design. Coverage of languages extends from an overview of operators, to SQL and and QBE (Query by Example), to integrity constraints and more. A full chapter probes the challenges of Ensuring Data Consistency, covering: Multi-User Operation Troubleshooting Consistency in Massive Distributed Data Comparison of the ACID and BASE consistency models, and more System Architecture also gets from its own chapter, which explores Processing of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Data; Storage and Access Structures; Multi-dimensional Data Structures and Parallel Processing with MapReduce, among other topics. Post-Relational and NoSQL Databases The chapter on post-relational databases discusses the limits of SQL – and what lies beyond, including Multi-Dimensional Databases, Knowledge Bases and and Fuzzy Databases. A final chapter covers NoSQL Databases, along with Development of Non-Relational Technologies, Key-Value, Column-Family and Document Stores XML Databases and Graphic Databases, and more The book includes more than 100 tables, examples and illustrations, and each chapter offers a list of resources for further reading. SQL & NoSQL Databases conveys the strengths and weaknesses of relational and non-relational approaches, and shows how to undertake development for big data applications. The book benefits readers including students and practitioners working across the broad field of applied information technology. This textbook has been recommended and developed for university courses in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.}

abstract="Selection of an appropriate database system for edge IoT devices is one of the essential elements that determine efficient edge-based data analysis in low power wireless sensor networks. This paper presents a comparative analysis of time series databases in the context of edge computing for IoT and Smart Systems. The research focuses on the performance comparison between three time-series databases: TimescaleDB, InfluxDB, Riak TS, as well as two relational databases, PostgreSQL and SQLite. All selected solutions were tested while being deployed on a single-board computer, Raspberry Pi. For each of them, the database schema was designed, based on a data model representing sensor readings and their corresponding timestamps. For performance testing, we developed a small application that was able to simulate insertion and querying operations. The results of the experiments showed that for presented scenarios of reading data, PostgreSQL and InfluxDB emerged as the most performing solutions. For tested insertion scenarios, PostgreSQL turned out to be the fastest. Carried out experiments also proved that low-cost, single-board computers such as Raspberry Pi can be used as small-scale data aggregation nodes on edge device in low power wireless sensor networks, that often serve as a base for IoT-based smart systems.",
