    abstract = {In recent years, the use of renewable energies has been promoted in most of developed countries due to the climate change threat. In this scenario, the importance of geothermal installations has increased. This paper focuses on a heat exchanger present on a geothermal installation. The main aim is to achieve an accurate prediction system using the previous readings of some of the sensors located along the heat exchanger. Different time series modeling techniques were applied obtaining satisfactory results in the prediction of the heat exchanger state during one year. This prediction is made 1 h, 3 h and 6 h in advance. Also, a strong correlation between the sensor readings is concluded, offering the possibility to dispense some of them.}

abstract = {Recent developments in maintenance modelling fuelled by data-based approaches such as machine learning (ML), have enabled a broad range of applications. In the automotive industry, ensuring the functional safety over the product life cycle while limiting maintenance costs has become a major challenge. One crucial approach to achieve this, is predictive maintenance (PdM). Since modern vehicles come with an enormous amount of operating data, ML is an ideal candidate for PdM. While PdM and ML for automotive systems have both been covered in numerous review papers, there is no current survey on ML-based PdM for automotive systems. The number of publications in this field is increasing — underlining the need for such a survey. Consequently, we survey and categorize papers and analyse them from an application and ML perspective. Following that, we identify open challenges and discuss possible research directions. We conclude that (a) publicly available data would lead to a boost in research activities, (b) the majority of papers rely on supervised methods requiring labelled data, (c) combining multiple data sources can improve accuracies, (d) the use of deep learning methods will further increase but requires efficient and interpretable methods and the availability of large amounts of (labelled) data.}

abstract = {Predictive maintenance of lithium-ion batteries has been one of the popular research subjects in recent years. Lithium-ion batteries can be used as the energy supply for industrial equipment, such as automated guided vehicles and battery electric vehicles. Predictive maintenance plays an important role in the application of smart manufacturing. This mechanism can provide different levels of pre-diagnosis for machines or components. Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is crucial for the implementation of predictive maintenance strategies. RUL refers to the estimated useful life remaining before the machine cannot operate after a certain period of operation. This study develops a hybrid data science model based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD), grey relational analysis (GRA), and deep recurrent neural networks (RNN) for the RUL prediction of lithium-ion batteries. The EMD and GRA methods are first adopted to extract the characteristics of time series data. Then, various deep RNNs, including vanilla RNN, gated recurrent unit, long short-term memory network (LSTM), and bidirectional LSTM, are established to forecast state of health (SOH) and the RUL of lithium-ion batteries. Bayesian optimization is also used to find the best hyperparameters of deep RNNs. Experimental results with the lithium-ion batteries data of NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository show that the proposed hybrid data science model can accurately predict the SOH and RUL of lithium-ion batteries. The LSTM network has the optimal results. The proposed hybrid data science model with multiple artificial intelligence-based technologies also demonstrates critical digital-technology enablers for digital transformation of smart manufacturing and transportation.}

abstract = {Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) have long been identified as a potential driver to improve system efficiency and lower labour costs in material handling systems. Accordingly, the reliability and availability of AGV systems is crucial to assure the stability and efficiency of these systems. However, the reliability issues and maintenance strategies of AGVs have not previously been studied sufficiently. This is even more marked in the case of multi-AGV systems that consist of fleets of AGVs. To fill this knowledge gap, research is conducted considering a multi-AGV system, consisting of three AGVs, in order to develop a scientific methodology for optimising the layout design, operation and maintenance of a multi-AGV system. Once an AGV is failed, it will be towed to the maintenance site for repair by a recycle vehicle to prevent deadlock and conflict. The efficiency of the recycling process of failed AGVs in a multi-AGV system, with respect to the change of location of the maintenance site, is analysed by the approach of coloured Petri nets (CPNs). A CPN model simulating the corrective and periodic preventive maintenance processes of failed AGVs is also developed in order to investigate the impact of different AGV maintenance strategies on the operation efficiency of the multi-AGV system. The simulation results obtained clearly show that the location of maintenance sites and maintenance strategies do have significant influence on the performance of a multi-AGV system, where corrective maintenance is an effective measure to maintain the long-term reliability and stability of the system.}
